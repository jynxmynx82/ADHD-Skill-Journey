A React Native/Expo app designed to help parents track and support their children with ADHD through a positive, adventure-based approach with visual flow metaphors to encourage resilience and progress tracking.

## 🎯 Project Status: **STABLE & PRODUCTION-READY**

**Current Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Status**: ✅ **Stable Core System** - Ready for family use

### 🛡️ Stability First Approach

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This project prioritizes **stability over new features**. The core system is working well and has been tested with real families. Any new components or features require:

- **Service layer** (lib/skillJourneyService.ts)
- **UI components** (components/)
- **Navigation structure** (app/(tabs)/)
- **Authentication flow** (context/AuthContext.tsx)

## 📈 Performance Metrics
