# Monetization: A Community-Supported Model

This document outlines the monetization strategy for the ADHD Skill Journey app. Our goal is to create a sustainable growth model that aligns with our core mission: to provide a genuinely helpful tool for families of children with ADHD.

This is not a traditional "Freemium vs. Premium" model. It is a **Community-Supported Model** where the core application is free and powerful, and a subscription is framed as a way for users to become "Supporters" who ensure the app's continued development and receive powerful enhancements in return.

## 💖 Our Philosophy: Purpose Before Profit

-   **We are Mission-Driven:** Our primary goal is to help families. Financial sustainability is the engine that powers the mission, not the other way around.
-   **Trust is Our Foundation:** We will never compromise user trust for a conversion. This means no aggressive tactics, no selling data, and no making users feel punished for not paying.
-   **Value is Given, Not Withheld:** The free version of our app will be a complete, valuable, and unlimited tool.

## 🎁 The Generous Free Tier: Our Promise to All Families

The free version of the app is our commitment to the community. It includes everything a family needs for the core task of tracking and supporting their child's journey.

-   **✅ Unlimited Core Functionality:**
    -   Add all children in your family.
    -   Create unlimited Skill Journeys.
    -   Log unlimited Adventures.
-   **✅ Secure Cloud Backup:** This is a core promise. Your data is precious and will always be securely backed up, free of charge. You will not lose your progress if you change devices.
-   **✅ The ADHD-Focused Food Scanner:** Our unique, custom-built food score that analyzes additives relevant to ADHD is **free for everyone**. This is a powerful tool we want all families to have.
-   **✅ Essential Tools Included:**
    -   **Basic Scheduling:** Create and manage daily schedules.
    -   **Basic Journaling:** Write unlimited plain text journal entries.
    -   **Basic Resources:** Access a curated selection of introductory articles.

## ⭐ The Supporter Tier: Help Us Grow

For families who find value in the app and want to support our mission, we offer a single, simple "Supporter" subscription. Becoming a supporter is not just about unlocking features; it's about investing in the app's future. In return for their support, users receive access to powerful enhancements.

-   **🤖 Unlimited AI Adventure Stories**: Your first few stories are on us! Supporters can create an unlimited number of magical, personalized stories to celebrate their child's journey.
-   **📈 Advanced PDF Reports**: A professional tool to help you advocate for your child in meetings with schools and therapists.
-   **🤝 Family & Therapist Sharing**: Securely collaborate with your support network.
-   **🗓️ Advanced Scheduling**: Unlock **Routine Templates** and **Multi-Child Views** for ultimate convenience.
-   **📓 Advanced Journaling**: Enhance your journal with **Audio Notes** and **Photo Attachments**.
-   **📚 Full Expert Resource Library**: Get complete access to our constantly growing library of in-depth guides and expert interviews.
-   **🥗 Food Scanner History & Trends**: Track your family's nutrition over time with unlimited scan history and trend analysis.

## 💬 How We Talk About It

The language we use in the app is critical.

-   We will avoid terms like "Upgrade Now" or "Unlock."
-   Instead, we will use phrases like **"Become a Supporter"** or **"Made possible by our Supporters."**
-   When gating a feature, the message will be positive: "Want to create magical AI stories? Become a Supporter to help us build new features like this one!"

This approach ensures that our monetization strategy is as supportive and positive as the app itself. It builds a loyal community of users who are invested in our mission and eager to help us grow sustainably.
