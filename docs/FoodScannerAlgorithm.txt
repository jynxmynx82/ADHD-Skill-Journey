Unraveling the Data: Does the "Yaku" Food App Offer API Access?
For users and developers looking to access the database of the food scanning application "Yaku," research indicates that the app in question is likely "Yuka," a popular platform for analyzing the health impact of food and cosmetic products. While a distinct, widely-used food app named "Yaku" with its own accessible database and API is not readily apparent, the ecosystem around Yuka provides a clear path for data access through a collaborative, open-source project.

Yuka, known for its barcode scanning feature that provides product information and health ratings, does not offer a direct, proprietary API to its specific database. Instead, Yuka, and other applications like it, leverage the extensive database of Open Food Facts.


Open Food Facts is a free, open, and collaborative database of food products from around the world. It is a non-profit project with a mission to make food data transparent and accessible to everyone. This is achieved through a public API that allows developers to access its vast repository of product information, including ingredients, nutritional values, and more.


A notable project that highlights this connection is the "Yaku-Project" available on GitHub. This backend application, explicitly inspired by Yuka, is built using data sourced from the Open Food Facts API. This further solidifies the understanding that applications in this space often rely on this open-source database rather than maintaining their own exclusive, accessible databases.

Therefore, while you may not find a direct API for a "Yaku" or even the official "Yuka" app, developers and researchers can gain access to the foundational data that powers these applications by utilizing the Open Food Facts API. This API provides a wealth of information for building similar applications, conducting research on food products, or integrating food data into other platforms.

For those interested in accessing this data, the Open Food Facts website provides comprehensive documentation on how to use their API, enabling a wide range of applications and innovations in the food tech space.

Thanks for clarifying. Yes it is the Yuka app. They implement a rating system that is better, I feel, than the French system of 'A' to 'F', and I was hoping to integrate that portion.




Show thinking
You're right to distinguish between Yuka's rating system and the standard French Nutri-Score. While the Nutri-Score is a key component, Yuka applies its own proprietary algorithm to arrive at its final "Excellent," "Good," "Poor," or "Bad" rating.

Unfortunately, Yuka does not offer a public or commercial API that allows developers to directly access their final calculated product score. The Yuka application uses an internal API to communicate between its mobile app and its backend servers, but this is not available for third-party integration.

How Yuka's Proprietary Rating System Works
Based on Yuka's official documentation, their scoring for food products is a weighted system that goes beyond the basic Nutri-Score:

60% Nutritional Quality: This portion of the score is based directly on the Nutri-Score system ("A" through "E"). This system evaluates factors like calories, sugar, salt, saturated fats, protein, fiber, and the percentage of fruits and vegetables.

30% Presence of Additives: This is a major differentiating factor. Yuka penalizes products based on the presence and risk level of food additives. Each additive is assigned a risk level (risk-free, limited, moderate, high-risk) based on scientific studies from bodies like the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The presence of a high-risk additive can cap a product's maximum score.

10% Organic Bonus: An additional bonus is applied if the product has an official organic certification (e.g., USDA Organic, AB - Agriculture Biologique).

This multi-faceted approach is why a product's Yuka score can differ significantly from what one might expect by looking at the Nutri-Score alone. The heavy penalty for certain additives is a hallmark of their system.

How You Can Integrate a Similar Rating System
While you cannot call a Yuka API to get their score, you can create a similar rating system by replicating their methodology using the Open Food Facts API. As you know, this is the underlying database for much of Yuka's information.

Here is a potential roadmap for integrating a "Yuka-style" rating:

Use the Open Food Facts API: For any given product, use the API to retrieve its complete data set.

Get the Nutritional Score: The Open Food Facts API directly provides the calculated Nutri-Score grade ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') for many products. This will form the 60% basis of your rating.

Analyze Additives: The API also provides a full list of ingredients and additives for a product. You would need to:

Create your own database or list of additives you wish to penalize, based on your own research or established lists.

Develop a scoring logic to subtract points based on the presence and perceived risk of each additive. This would replicate the 30% "Additives" component of the Yuka score.

Check for Organic Certification: The Open Food Facts API includes "labels" and "traces" tags. You can parse this data to check for terms like "organic," "bio," etc., to apply your 10% bonus.

Calculate the Final Score: Combine the scores from the nutritional quality, additives, and organic bonus to generate your own final rating.

This approach gives you complete control and transparency over your rating system while allowing you to build a system that you and your users find more comprehensive, similar to how Yuka has improved upon the base Nutri-Score.






In this particular context, the additives would be those that could affect a child with ADHD. What kind of list would you create based on this repurposing of the addictive calculation?




Show thinking
That's an excellent and very specific application of this concept. Repurposing the additive calculation to focus on triggers for a child with ADHD is a powerful way to customize the rating system.

Based on scientific studies, clinical observations, and well-known dietary approaches like the Feingold Diet, you can create a targeted list. Here’s how you could structure that list and the associated logic, designed for this specific purpose.

Important Disclaimer:
I am an AI assistant and not a medical professional. The information below is for informational and technical purposes only. It is crucial to consult with a pediatrician, registered dietitian, or a pediatric neurologist before making any significant dietary changes for a child with ADHD. They can provide guidance based on the individual child's health and the current state of medical research.

A Tiered List of Additives for Your Calculation
The key is to create a weighted system. Not all additives have the same level of evidence linking them to behavioral changes. A tiered approach allows you to apply a much larger penalty for the most studied substances.

Here is a sample list, broken into three tiers of concern.

Tier 1: High-Risk (Strongest Scientific Association)
This group consists of the "Southampton Six" artificial colors, which were the subject of a landmark 2007 UK study funded by the Food Standards Agency. This study led to mandatory warning labels in the EU for foods containing these colors. You should also include the preservative studied alongside them.

Logic: The presence of any Tier 1 additive could automatically cap the product's score at "Poor" or apply a very significant point deduction (e.g., -40 to -50 points on a 100-point scale).

The List:

E110 - Sunset Yellow FCF (Yellow #6)

E104 - Quinoline Yellow

E122 - Carmoisine

E129 - Allura Red AC (Red #40)

E102 - Tartrazine (Yellow #5)

E124 - Ponceau 4R

E211 - Sodium Benzoate (a preservative often studied with the colors)

Tier 2: Moderate-Risk (Commonly Cited & Studied)
This group includes other artificial colors, preservatives, and artificial sweeteners frequently cited by organizations like the Feingold Association or in other clinical observations as potential triggers.

Logic: Apply a moderate penalty for each Tier 2 additive found (e.g., -15 to -20 points).

The List:

Other Artificial Colors:

E133 - Brilliant Blue FCF (Blue #1)

E132 - Indigotine (Blue #2)

E142 - Green S (Green #3)

Preservatives (BHA, BHT, TBHQ):

E320 - Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)

E321 - Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)

E319 - Tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ)

Artificial Sweeteners:

E951 - Aspartame

E950 - Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K)

E955 - Sucralose

Tier 3: Caution (Broader & Anecdotal Links)
This group contains additives where the link is more controversial or based on broader dietary theories. You might assign a smaller penalty here, allowing users to be aware without dramatically altering the score.

Logic: Apply a small penalty for each Tier 3 additive (e.g., -5 to -10 points).

The List:

E621 - Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)

Nitrates & Nitrites:

E250 - Sodium Nitrite

E251 - Sodium Nitrate

E252 - Potassium Nitrate

"Artificial Flavors": This is a tricky one. The Open Food Facts API won't break down what's in "artificial flavors." You could create a rule that if the ingredients list contains the string artificial flavor or artificial flavour, a small penalty is applied.

How to Implement This Logic
When you make a call to the Open Food Facts API for a product, you would:

Retrieve Additives: Get the list of additives from the additives_tags array. This gives you the E-numbers directly (e.g., en:e110).

Parse Ingredients for Strings: For terms like "artificial flavors," you would need to parse the ingredients_text field.

Apply Your Scoring:

Check if any additive from Tier 1 is present. If yes, apply the major penalty.

For the remaining additives, check if they fall into Tier 2 and apply the moderate penalty for each.

Finally, check for Tier 3 additives and apply the small penalty.

By creating a scoring system based on these targeted, tiered lists, you would successfully repurpose the additive calculation to create a highly valuable tool for parents and individuals managing ADHD through diet.






What would the 'math' be to move to a 'out of 100' score using?



Show thinking
Of course. Let's translate the framework we've discussed into a clear mathematical formula that results in a final score out of 100. This model is designed to be logical, customizable, and directly reflect your goal of flagging products potentially affecting a child with ADHD.

We will base our math on the Yuka structure, assigning a maximum point value to each component:

Nutritional Quality: 60 points

Additives: 30 points

Organic Bonus: 10 points

Total: 100 points

Here is the step-by-step math for each part.

Part 1: The Nutritional Score (Max: 60 points)
First, you need to convert the letter-based Nutri-Score into a number. A simple linear conversion works best.

Nutri-Score

Point Value

A

60

B

48

C

36

D

24

E

12

None

0


Export to Sheets
Formula: NutritionalScore = Points from Nutri-Score Grade

Part 2: The Additive Score (Max: 30 points)
This is the core of your custom logic. You will start with a perfect score of 30 and subtract points based on the presence of the targeted additives.

Let's assign penalties to the tiers we created:

Tier 1 Penalty (High-Risk): -50 points. This is a "super penalty" designed to heavily punish the score.

Tier 2 Penalty (Moderate-Risk): -15 points per additive.

Tier 3 Penalty (Caution): -5 points per additive.

The Calculation Steps:

Start with a base of 30 points.

Check for Tier 1 additives. If one or more are found, apply the -50 penalty. Because this penalty is so large, you can decide to stop here and not add penalties from other tiers if a Tier 1 is present.

If no Tier 1 additives are found, check for Tier 2. For each one you find, subtract 15 points.

Check for Tier 3 additives. For each one you find, subtract 5 points.

The final score for this section cannot be negative. If the penalties exceed 30, the score is 0.

Formula:
AdditivePenalties = (Tier1_Penalty) + (Count_of_Tier2_Additives * 15) + (Count_of_Tier3_Additives * 5)
AdditiveScore = MAX(0, 30 - AdditivePenalties)

Part 3: The Organic Bonus (Max: 10 points)
This is a simple binary calculation.

If the product has a recognized organic certification (e.g., USDA Organic, AB - Agriculture Biologique, etc.) from the Open Food Facts API labels field, it gets 10 points.

If not, it gets 0 points.

Formula: OrganicBonus = 10 (if certified organic) or 0 (if not)

The Final Calculation (Putting It All Together)
Now, you simply add the scores from the three parts.

Final Score=(NutritionalScore)+(AdditiveScore)+(OrganicBonus)
Examples in Action
Let's run two sample products through this formula.

Example 1: Organic Apple & Raspberry Fruit Bar

Nutrition: Nutri-Score 'B' -> NutritionalScore = 48

Additives: Contains one Tier 3 additive (E621 - MSG was added for some reason).

AdditivePenalties = (0) + (0 * 15) + (1 * 5) = 5

AdditiveScore = MAX(0, 30 - 5) = 25

Organic: It is certified organic.

OrganicBonus = 10

Final Score: 48 + 25 + 10 = 83

Example 2: Brightly Colored Children's Cereal

Nutrition: Nutri-Score 'D' -> NutritionalScore = 24

Additives: Contains E110 (Sunset Yellow, a Tier 1) and E951 (Aspartame, a Tier 2).

We immediately see a Tier 1 additive.

AdditivePenalties = 50 (We apply the super penalty)

AdditiveScore = MAX(0, 30 - 50) = 0

Organic: It is not organic.

OrganicBonus = 0

Final Score: 24 + 0 + 0 = 24

Translating the Score to a Rating
Finally, you can translate your 0-100 score into a simple, user-friendly rating:

Score Range

Suggested Rating

85 - 100

Excellent

70 - 84

Good

50 - 69

Fair

Below 50

Poor / Best Avoided

This mathematical framework provides a robust, logical, and customizable way to generate the exact rating system you envisioned.






I am Also creating ADHD focused categories for quick selection in a journal format inside of the application. Can you give me a broad list of quick category items and then also a short list, that's easier to do in the short term?




Show thinking
Of course. Creating quick-select categories is an excellent way to reduce the friction of journaling, which is especially important for an ADHD-focused app. Here are two lists—a comprehensive one for your long-term vision and a shorter one that's perfect for initial implementation.

The Broad List (Long-Term Implementation)
This list is designed to be comprehensive, allowing users to track a wide range of factors that influence their ADHD experience over time. These could be presented as different sections within a daily journal entry.

Focus & Productivity

Focus Level: (e.g., A 1-5 scale, or options like: Scattered, Distracted, Neutral, Engaged, Hyperfocused)

Procrastination: (e.g., None, A little, A lot, Avoided a key task)

Task Initiation: (e.g., Easy to start, Hard to start)

Task Completion: (A simple text box for "What I finished today:")

Big Win: (Celebrating an accomplishment, no matter how small)

Biggest Challenge: (What was the hardest part of the day?)

Time Perception: (e.g., Time moved too fast, Time dragged, Lost track of time)

Mind & Mood

Overall Mood: (Could use emojis or words: Happy, Anxious, Irritable, Calm, Overwhelmed, Optimistic)

Emotional Regulation: (e.g., Felt stable, Big mood swings, Felt frustrated, Experienced RSD - Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)

Mental Energy: (e.g., Energized, Brain fog, Fatigued)

Source of Joy: (What made you smile?)

Source of Stress: (What drained your energy?)

Impulse Control: (e.g., Felt in control, Made an impulsive decision - spending, eating, etc.)

Health & Body

Sleep Quality: (e.g., A 1-5 scale, or options like: Restful, Interrupted, Poor)

Medication: (e.g., Taken on time, Taken late, Missed dose, N/A)

Nutrition Note: (A quick entry to correlate with your food rating app: e.g., "Ate well," "High sugar," "Ate a trigger food")

Exercise/Movement: (e.g., None, Light walk, Gym session, Stretched)

Physical Restlessness: (e.g., Calm, Fidgety, Needed to move)

Environment & Social

Workspace: (e.g., Organized, Cluttered, Distracting)

Social Battery: (e.g., Fully charged, Socially active, Needed alone time, Drained)

Positive Connection: (Note a positive interaction with someone)

The Short List (Easier to Implement First)
This list is a high-impact subset of the broad list. It's designed for quick, daily logging to provide the most value with the least amount of effort for the user. This is a great starting point for your app.

Focus Level (1-5 Scale): The core metric. How focused were you today?

Today's Win: What's one thing you're proud of? (Crucial for building self-esteem).

Today's Hurdle: What was one thing you struggled with? (Helps identify patterns).

Overall Mood (Emoji/Word Select): A quick snapshot of emotional state (e.g., 😊, 😐, 😠, 😟).

Medication Taken? (Yes/No/N/A): A simple, essential tracking point.

Sleep Quality (Poor/Fair/Good): A fundamental pillar of managing ADHD symptoms.

Noteworthy Meal: (A quick text note about a meal, good or bad, to link back to your food analysis idea).
